echo "🔧 Fixing Migration Issues for Laravel Cloud Deployment\n";
echo "=====================================================\n\n";

echo "📋 The issue was in the notification_deliveries migration.\n";
echo "   The notifications table uses UUID primary key, but notification_deliveries\n";
echo "   was trying to reference it with an integer foreign key.\n\n";

echo "✅ Fixed: Updated notification_deliveries migration to use UUID foreign key.\n\n";

echo "🚀 Next Steps:\n\n";

echo "1. 📦 Commit the fixed migration:\n";
echo "   git add database/migrations/2025_08_14_145112_create_notification_deliveries_table.php\n";
echo "   git commit -m \"Fix notification_deliveries foreign key constraint\"\n";
echo "   git push\n\n";

echo "2. 🔄 Reset and re-run migrations on Laravel Cloud:\n";
echo "   - Go to your Laravel Cloud dashboard\n";
echo "   - Navigate to your project\n";
echo "   - Go to 'Database' section\n";
echo "   - Click 'Reset Database' (if available)\n";
echo "   - Or manually drop and recreate the database\n\n";

echo "3. 🗄️  Alternative: Run these commands via Laravel Cloud CLI:\n";
echo "   laravel cloud db:reset\n";
echo "   laravel cloud db:migrate\n";
echo "   laravel cloud db:seed\n\n";

echo "4. 🧪 Test the deployment:\n";
echo "   - Check if migrations run successfully\n";
echo "   - Verify all tables are created\n";
echo "   - Test the application functionality\n\n";

echo "📖 Migration Files Fixed:\n";
echo "   ✅ database/migrations/2025_08_14_145112_create_notification_deliveries_table.php\n\n";

echo "🔍 What was changed:\n";
echo "   - Changed 'foreignId('notification_id')' to 'uuid('notification_id')'\n";
echo "   - Added explicit foreign key constraint with proper UUID reference\n\n";

echo "🎉 Your Laravel application should now deploy successfully!\n\n";
